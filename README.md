Valheim World Share FrontEnd README

This Single Page application was designed to share worlds that were created in the newly popular video game Valheim(hence the generic name)...

As a user, you can post your world information that will be available to comment on by yourself and other users. These changes will occur without refreshing the page to keep the data available for the user(s).
A user will be able to attach an image link to show off their world along with entering in their world seed code generated by the game.

BACKEND REPO:

THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE TESTING: 

- There is some seed data as an example so that its not a barren SPA.

- Postgresql was used to manage the database rather than sqlite3

- Project AS IS for time being is MVP for now as I learn more about javascript and css.

- I have a stretch feature commented out in the code right now. Like buttons are visible but not working at the moment.
